# Screensaver Dashboard extension for GNOME

Interactive screen dashboard for your kitchen computer

This GNOME extension implements an interactive dashboard as screen saver

It subscribes to user activity idle events and when user is inactive, it shows a dashboard with hour and date (weather, shortcuts coming)

It also listens for noise in the microphone, turning off the screen into power saving mode, and showing the dashboard when there is noise
